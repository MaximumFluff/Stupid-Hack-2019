# Stupid Hack 2019 Project
## Developed by Janne Johannson, Adrian Wilcock, Alex Jacobs & Trevor Hurt

### Description
Many businesses require login pages for their websites, but they don't want to pay web developers to build it, so we developed an easy to use template for login pages! guaranteed easy to use.

### How to Run

- In one terminal window, navigate to the folder for the backend, and run NPM START to get the backend up and running
- In the second terminal window, navigate to the root of the repository folder and run NPM start to get the frontend running
- Have fun! :D
