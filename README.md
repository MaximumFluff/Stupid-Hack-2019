# Stupid Hack 2019 Project
## Developed by Janne Johansson, Adrian Wilcock, Alex Jacobs & Trevor Hurt

### Description
Many businesses require login pages for their websites, but they don't want to pay web developers to build it, so we developed an easy to use template for login pages! guaranteed easy to use.

### How to Run

- In one terminal window, navigate to the folder for the backend
- Run 'npm i' to install those juicy node modules
- Run 'npm start' to get the backend service up and running
- In the second terminal window, navigate to the root of the repository folder and run 'npm i' then 'npm start' to get the frontend up and running
- Have fun! :D
